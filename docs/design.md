# frameledger — Design

> **Purpose — so the shape is decided once, and anyone can tell where a
> new piece of work belongs and what it is allowed to touch.**

**This document is a gate.** Work is not broken into items until it is
agreed — `~/.claude/workflow.md` § 4 says when it passes.

**Status:** not started. When the gate passes: `agreed (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
Replace each `>` guidance block with your own text as you fill it in.

## The parts

> One line each: what this part is responsible for, **and which files it is.**
> You cannot place work without knowing the parts, and you cannot deal work
> to several sessions without knowing which parts share files.
> `~/.claude/standards/coding.md` § 1.8 owns that rule and its bound — the
> bound matters as much as the rule, because a file per function is the
> failure and not the goal. Cheap to decide here; expensive to retrofit.

## What may depend on what

> The load-bearing section — this is what stops the shape rotting, and it
> is what the pick-an-item gate reads. State the rules, not just the
> arrows: which parts may call which, and which must never.
>
> A diagram is welcome and is not a substitute. It renders this section;
> it does not replace it.

## What every part does the same way

> Errors, state, persistence, logging. Decided once here, or every item
> invents its own.

## The stack, and what it rules out

> What was chosen, one sentence of why each, and the runner-up. The
> "rules out" half matters more than it looks: it is what stops a later
> item assuming something the stack cannot do.

## Close calls

> Each gets an ADR in `docs/decisions/`, so it is not re-argued later.
> List them here with a link; the reasoning lives there.

## Cold-eyes loop log

> A design doc is gated (`documentation.md` § 9.1) and is owed no
> `## What checks this` table, so the log goes last. `review-contract`
> writes a row per loop as the loops happen; never back-fill one.
